Power

    Needs to be there before anything else to power utilities
    Uses money and natural resources to create power
    Usage rises in the summer

    Consumers:
    Production - Mostly never (0.1kW)
    Consumption - kW demand (10kW)
    Consumption Max - Defined max value rather than calculated (20kW)
    Consumption Min - Defined min value to just function (0.1kW)
    Storage - Store less than a kW (0.1kW)
    Storage Max - Max kW able to store (0.2kW)
    Value when 0 - May have on site power generation using another resource (5kW)

    Producers:
    Production - kW generated (1000kW)
    Max - kW able to generate (10,000kW)
    Consumption - kW per other network unit (100 Gas)
    Consumption Max - Defined max value rather than calculated (1000 Gas)
    Consumption Min - Defined min value to just function (0.1 Gas)
    Storage - None in most cases (0 kW)
    Storage Max - None in most cases (0 kW)

Water

    Uses power to create water
    Stops making water and stops using power when there is water pollution
    Residents don't live where there isn't water

    Consumers:
    Production - Only rural (50 gal)
    Consumption - gal demand (100 gal)

    Producers:
    Production - 1000 gal
    Storage - 1000 gal
    Storage Max - 1000 gal

Fire

    When a tile has no water, there is a higher fire risk

Gas

    Reduces power usage in buildings during the winter

Population

    Number of residents. Working class seek low commute time, low garbage, low crime, low pollution. High class seek low commute time, low garbage, no crime, high value, no pollution.

Jobs

    Population changes demand on job market, and job market changes demand on population. Investors look for new development. Startups look for cities. Franchises add more jobs and attract baseline population but decrease value.

Traffic

    Just the traffic volume on a section of road

Garbage

Value

    Perceived value of the tile

Crime

    Lowers value, raises water usage, raises power usage, increases neighboring crime

Education

    Lowers crime, raises value, increases health

Health

    Lowers crime, increases life expectancy, raises value

Resource creation

    Coal
    Oil
    Iron
    Sand -> Glass, Silicon
    Silicon -> Electronics
    Electronics -> High tech
    Coal, Iron -> Steel
    Oil -> Plastic
    Wood
    Wood -> Paper, Furniture

    Steel -> Manufacturing
    Plastic -> Manufacturing

    Manufacturing -> Cars

Freight time

    Train
    Plane

Commute time
    
    Train
    Internet
    Car
    Walking
    Subway
    Monorail
    High speed train

Mail, Distribution centers, Warehouses

    Increases manufacturing demand
    Increases freight export/import
    Decreases value
    Increases efficiency of commercial

Zoning

    Residential
    Commercial

Networks rely on each other, they produce, consume, or transform.


Store a distance value for each node in the network?

Network distribution styles
    First come first serve (per utility network, water)
    Road distance (ability to use the road network, police)
    Direct displacement (radius, pollution)
    Even distribution (per sum of input/output, power)

Who does the distribution style?
    Game loop

Does share with network?

Each consumer or producer may have a network event fire multiple times

Tick fired in network increases or decreases production or consumption

Fire tick before balancing entire network, therefore user does not see the network in an inplausible / unbalanced state

Water producers fire before consumers. Consumers use producers.
Power consumers fire before producers. Producers match consumers.

When production is greater than prod max, use storage
When production is less than prod max, stow to storage
When consumption is greater than consumption max, use storage
When consumption is greater than input, use storage
When consumption is less than input, stow to storage


Update scheme per network per month for power
Network is in "past month" state until ticked
Ideally 'available' == 'demand' after consumer tick
Since we can have multiple networks, simply add supply from all networks. If a single network can't power a building, its ratio will be less during distribution.
- Sum shared max production (1ms)
- Sum shared production (1p)
- Sum shared current storage (1s)
- Sum network supply (1u=1p+1s)
- Sum max network supply (1mu=1ms+1s)
- Sum network demand (1d)
- If 1d > 1mu 
    > Based upon distribution type, distribute
    > Production currently cannot meet demand

* Tick consumers
    > Required to see if demand can be met now
    > Demand changes for the next month supply/demand calculation
    > Sets demand for storage too
    - If 'available' >= 'demand'
        - If 'available' >= 'consumption'
            available -= consumption
            storage += available
    else
    - If 'available' < 'demand'
        available -= consumption
        if (available < 0)
            available += storage
- Set consumers' available to 0
- Sum network demand (2d)
- Distribute demand (2d) evenly to producers' demand

* Tick producers
    > Will set new production numbers based upon 2d
    > They do not desire to store unless network supply is greater than network demand
    > Set available to production? No it's usually production
- Sum shared max production (2m)
- Sum shared production (2p)
- Sum shared current storage (2s)
- Sum network supply (2u=2p+2s)
- Sum max network supply (2mu=2m+2s) 
- Sum network demand (2d)
- If 2d > 2mu
    > available < consumer demand
- Power is evenly distributed
- 2l=2d/2u 
- Set consumers' available to 2l*(consumer demand)
- Add 2l*(consumer demand) to consumers' supply


What exactly is the network calculating?
- Let plops define how they interact with the network
- By default consumers demand, producers supply, networks connect, controller balances


What happens when a plop wants to determine game functionality based on whether or not the network can provide?
Or
What happens when a plop wants to pull from the network during the month due to increased consumption?
Or
A chain of actions, house needs more water, pulls water network into deficit, water pump needs more electricity, pulls electric grid into deficit, electric grid needs more electricity, pulls funding into deficit.


Should be fine with monthly calculations. Design buildings to store enough resources for the month to fit within production ability if you wish to do 'during month' calculations.
